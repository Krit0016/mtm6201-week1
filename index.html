                    Hello to everyone. My name is Orranis Krittayaruangkit, and I am from Thailand. I am a first-year IMD (interactive media design) student at Algonquin College who is interested in design and determined to thrive in the profession. 
                    I am committed to remaining current with industry trends and consistently increasing my skill set through coursework and self-study. 
                    I'm looking for opportunities to put my expertise and creativity to use on real-world design projects. 
                    I wish to become better at understanding user demands and translating them into visually appealing and useful designs, as well as having a creative attitude. 
                    I am motivated to make a meaningful impact in the field of interactive media design.
                </p>
